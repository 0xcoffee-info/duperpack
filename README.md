# DuperPack

Extraction tool for native libraries within Meta applications like WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger. This tool uses Github Actions to patch, install, and extract files from the associated Meta application. Those native libraries will be available once the GitHub action completes (~15 minutes per run).

This tool could definitely be improved but it gets the job done ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## How to use
Fork this repository and then replace the WhatsApp.apk with a WhatsApp.apk from your mirror of choice. Once the WhatsApp.apk has been replaced (currently requires the Universal .apk) commit and push to github.
